# Docs for developers: book review 
_Reviewed by Natalia Dowding_   

## Introduction

Unlike many other books in this field, the book is not written not for writers but for developers who are called for creating their own documentation. The aim of the authors is to equip developers with a comprehensive guide for successful and effective documentation writing.  

This relatively small volume covers several topics, leading the aspiring writer through all steps of documentation creation, from audience analysis to maintenance and deprecating. Each of these topics is a big subject on its own. The authors aim was to create a concise guidance to accompany the beginner writer at each step of the process. They took the path of extracting the bare essentials and leaving the details behind. The authors provide additional references and a list of useful resources in the Appendix for further study.  

To illustrate the process and the pitfalls that developers may face during their writing process, the authors include a story of a fictional software company named Corg.ly. 

This small company develops a cute software toolkit, which translates dog barks to English. At the end of the development process, the company finds itself in need of creating user documentation for their product.

Each chapter sets out from a some kind of daily situation at Corg.ly. ==They serve as an illustration as to why a particular stage is for as why is it important==

## What is between the book covers

The book follows the documenting process step by step  in its working order, from planning and user research to maintenance. The first part of the book deals with the writing and publishing aspects of the job, taking us through each stage of the process. The second part introduces the practicalities of gathering feedback, establishing quality metrics and planning the maintenance. 

==Indeed, writing is not what developers do on a daily basis and there are significant differences between coding and writing== 

Throughout the book, the authors show lots of sympathy to developers. Wherever appropriate, they point out similarities between coding and writing. They seek to convince the reader that they are not alone to have problems with writing. And this is not because of they lack of ability, but because writing is difficult. Feeling stuck during their writing pretty or getting stuck is common among the writers and the authors offer several way to overcome this problem.

In trying to help the developers, the authors choose the most  methods which might appear the most appealing to developers, bringing in parallels with the development process and providing plentiful advice.  Using templates is one of them and I find it is one [TODO: finish off the sentence].

I feel that though planning is indispensable, developers might need more advice on the matter. But sometimes more is needed to start a person writing. There are methods that work for many writers and sharing that experience with developers will only help them on this journey.

### Going through chapters

In the very first chapter the authors introduce the reader to the audience analysis. Understanding the needs of your users can make all the difference in deciding on the purpose of your documentation and on what should be included into it. 

The authors take the reader through methodologies of studying your user. The reader will learn about "the curse of knowledge" and how to create user personas. 

Once the developer learned more about his audience, the authors move on to discussing the outline of the future documentation. Here reader will find out about the most common content types will learn how to plan his documentation.

These stages are often overlooked by development teams.The authors insist that it is critical to understand the user goal, his level of expertise and decide on what content to include to produce the efficient documentation. 

Time pressure often overshadows the importance of preparation. To challenge this situation the authors bring forward a case of writer's block. They argue that analysing the audience and planning the content is a critical first step when facing a blank page. Knowing the purpose and the type of content can be your first step in defeating difficulties of writing. 

[TODO:think if talking about planning your software is the same as or similar to planning your content]

 For developers, who might see writing as a vague, creative process, this will help them to start off on the right foot.
 
Having gained a good idea who your users are, what they want achieve with your documentation and planned your content, the author move on to talk about drafting.

Drafting is, probably, one of the most difficult stages of writing project. Both coding and writing are creative processes, but they are unquestionably done differently. What authors achieved here is that they present drafting as a logical, methodical job, rather than spontaneous and mysterious activity. Which must be seem very appealing to the developers, who often see writing as impulsive work, dependant on waves of inspiration.

The authors will start with explaining how to design an outline,and then introduce the most common elements of content, such as lists and headers. What I find particularly attractive in this book, is that with any new task they introduce, they also provide a list of questions that the might want to check before moving forward to the next task. [TODO: think how to rephrase the next sentence] This a proved tool to ensure the quality of documentation and that it is aligned with users' expectations.

 
[TODO:reconsider the next three paragraphs. Do we really need them?]
The authors introduce the most common categories of content. For each category, the authors describe the most common types of documents. For example, tutorials belong to the procedural type while the design notes fall into the conceptual category. For each category authors discuss the structure of the document: a how-to guide will likely contain a number of steps to achieve a necessary result. 

Introducing the structure is important for a beginner writer. Having a pattern or template in mind eliminates the difficult task of designing the model for such documents which can be a difficult task in itself. Tapping into the experience of others allows the developer to concentrate on writing alone.

Drafting might be challenging for developers even after thorough planning. The authors seem to be very sympathetic, first by providing guidance to this process and secondly by sharing advice on what to do if you are getting stuck. 

It can be very tempting for non-writers to publish their document straight after creating the first draft. Comparing editing to testing must be the most convincing argument for developers. Where possible, authors draw parallels between the coding and writing processes, be it conceptual similarities or mere processing environment.  

[START HERE]
As before, the authors propose a strategy to follow, they show a few points to keep in mind when editing and reviewing, to help the developer to go through editing tasks easier. 

Having seen a good amount of advice, though concise as it may be, on the topic of getting back into the flow, I was surprised at finding it quite opposite with the editing. 

Writing is difficult precisely because it can not follow a prescription. Which is why the novices need tools to deal with the problems they might encounter. Authors leave scant resources on style and grammar. Understanding the authors’ desire not to overwhelm developers, more resources on style and language would help.

After discussing textual elements of documentation, the authors move on to visuals and code samples. 

Unlike with writing, developers are probably feeling much at home with code samples. Facing a relentless stream of new technologies, apps, tools and languages to deal with, developers know all too well how important code samples may be to better grasp new material. It is hard to overestimate the role of code samples when you are trying to engage a new user.  

The authors present good practices for creating effective and reliable code samples and advocate for thoroughly testing the samples and verifying their relevance to the current version of the product.  

Nobody nowadays will argue about the effectiveness of visual materials in the documentation. As with code samples, developers deal with charts and diagrams in their daily life. They understand well the significance of good visual material for good comprehension.

Much can be said of numerous tools and apps available on the market, but the authors keep their focus on the principles, rather than going into the details of tools. They explain the practical steps of creating efficient and appealing visuals. This approach allows them to put priorities in the right order: structure comes first, esthetics - second. The authors also leave some interesting resources for developers to draw upon.

Unlike code samples, the publishing stage might be less known to developers. Here developers will find out that publishing is not so much about the choice of tools, but about planning, which makes all the difference. This is one of my favourite chapters because again, all the basics are laid out in a succinct, clear way.

In the second part of the book, the developer is introduced to the methods of improving and maintaining the documentation.

Gathering the feedback and measuring the quality of the documentation are often overlooked. The authors present a number of practical ways for collecting feedback, introducing improvements and evaluating the quality of the documentation using various metrics so that the task appears more manageable. 

Similarly, the authors propose several practical ways for the developer to evaluate the quality of the documentation. They explain the concepts of functional and structural quality and provide methods to translate them into meaningful values.

For many developers, documentation metrics would be a novel concept which is why this chapter may be of special interest to them. 

The chapter on organising the documentation is particularly appealing to me.
Making sure that the user can find his way in documentation, and that it is appearing logically and intuitively organised, plays an important part in establishing good relationships with the user. Information architecture is a big subject in itself. Nowadays many developers would have some exposure to IA, but here the authors provide a concise guide to how developers can use it for their own documentation without going into the details.

At last, the authors touch on the topic of maintenance. Ensuring that the documentation is up-to-date at all times is very important to secure the trust and satisfaction of users. In a few short sections, the authors manage to distil the best practices for maintenance and deprecating documentation. 

Reviewer’s comments

The first impression from the book was that in simplifying the presentation of material the authors went a little too far. However, if you look at it from the developer’s perspective, you start to appreciate the author’s approach all the more. Surely, much can be added to each topic, discussed in this book. But the authors keep their explanations brief, making the book a kind of “plan of attack” for beginner writers.

Taking this approach, the authors set an ambition task for themselves. Still, I feel that at times the strive for brevity of simplicity goes a few notches too far.  

Take, for example, an explanation of a paragraph. Presenting a paragraph as a section of text which provides a context for a procedure or that it may contain a story illustrating a concept, rather than as a logical subdivision of text, seems to be confusing and hardly logical. A few more suggestions for drafting could also be of benefit, for example using lists when describing procedures.

Overall, I feel that the book might benefit from more examples. The story of Corg.ly does not fill that gap for me. There is a feeling of imbalance between the overly cheerful Corg.ly company and an abstract presentation of subsequent material.

At times, I felt the text is overly simplistic, and at times I would have appreciated more examples. I also think suggesting more resources for developers may be a good idea. 

Having said that, I like the overall style of the book: clear, cheerful and sympathetic. Bearing in mind that the community of developers is far from being uniform and the authors did a very good job of accommodating this highly diverse crowd. 

Authors take a position to avoid any references on software to use. This seems to be a wise approach as there is no shortage of products on the market. Considering the variety of products available and the speed with which they go obsolete, this is the most rational approach. 

Overall, I think that any development team looking at the prospect of creating their own documentation should read this book. It is full of valuable advice and exemplifies the very style in which the documents should be written: clear and concise. The book might answer many questions and overcome many hurdles on the way to creating documentation.
